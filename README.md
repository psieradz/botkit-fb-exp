# botkit-fb-exp

This is a PoC project for IBM Watson based Facebook chat-bot.

The solution consists of several components, namely:

* The actual bot and its (extremely simple for now) conversation flow, hosted on Bluemix;
* Node.js application based on Botkit framework, hosted on Glitch.com;
* Facebook "Watson-experimental" application;
* Facebook "Watson-exp" page;

HOW TO MAKE FB BOT ANSWER?

Unfortunately, in order to make a fb bot answer to anyone who starts a conversation the application itself needs to be published and that involves serious amount of effort, including a preparation of a privacy policy and a dedicated host that would exposeit and I'm to lazy to deal with it. 
The workaround it to share your facebook name with me (via email, google+, github or whatever your preferences are) so that I can make you an official application tester. 

Once you become a tester you'll just need to search for "Watson-exp" page on FB and send it a chat message.

HURRY UP

IBM will only let me test their products for free for next 29 days. Good news is we could easily use some alternative (like Recast.AI
or even MS Bot framework using someone's free monthly 200$). 

NEXT STEPS

* For now the bot will only answer to several greetings and farewells, its extremely simple to customize it though;
* Slack integration (we should have a slack channel anyway);
* Custom chat application;
* Replacing Watson with something free;

DEVELOPERS

Let me know if you want to get involved, the sooner the better as I'll need to setup all the bloody permissions for you.
